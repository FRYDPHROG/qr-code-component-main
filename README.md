## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

In this lesson, i've learned how to center a div within the body of a webpage and have also learned the importance of padding

```css
.container{
    width: 500px;
    background-color: white;
    border-radius: 2rem;
    padding: 2rem;
    text-align: center;
    box-shadow: 0 5px 10px gray;
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```

### Continued development

The problems that i am still having is how to configure it so the design looks the same throughout different device screens. Something I also need to work on is how to properly use github 


### Useful resources

- [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me with most of the simple problems i was facing and the ones that i just kept forgetting.
